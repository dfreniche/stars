![](stars.gif)

This is a small program/demo that shows a "Star Field" like demo. Written for the AMSTRAD CPC range of computers.

## How to run

- copy latest DSK disk image to a suitable mass storage device. You can copy it to a real 3" disc using CPC Disk XP, or to a 3"1/2 disc (you'll need a PC floppy drive attached to your AMSTRAD)
- you can also open the DSK file using any [AMSTRAD emulator](http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Emulators)
- you can also open the DSK using this [CPCBox, the AMSTRAD online emulator](https://www.retrovm.com) 

## Controls

- use the cursor keys to change the direction of the star field
- press H for an Hyperspace-like effect!

## How to compile

- Install CPCTelera v1.5 (toolchain used to develop this demo)
- Clone this repo using `git clone` (or download a ZIP with all the code)
- `cd stars`
- `make`
